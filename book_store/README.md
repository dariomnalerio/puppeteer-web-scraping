## Puppeteer Book Scraper

This is a simple exercise that uses Puppeteer to scrape book data from the website https://books.toscrape.com/ and saves it to a JSON file. The scraped data includes the book title, price, image source, and rating.

The main() function launches a headless browser, navigates to the website, scrapes the data, saves it to a JSON file, and closes the browser.
